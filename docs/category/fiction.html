<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>EXT: THE SUN - DAY</p>
<p><i>Somebody find out if we're allowed to get a direct shot of the Sun, because I know you're not supposed to look directly at it but I don't know if it counts if you film directly at it and watch the film. If no one knows maybe get an intern to try it out. Anyway, assuming we get the shot, pan down to a desert landscape. Cactus, animal skulls, all the tropes. Mountains in the background blur as hot air rises from the sand. In the foreground a scorpion scuttles into view, pauses to wipe sweat from its brow, then suddenly flees as a person's stomping foot fills the frame. Zoom out to reveal HUGH, WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE PLAYED BY JAMES FRANCO, hiking alone through the wilderness.</i></p>

<p><i>He stops suddenly and stares into the distance: he has spotted something interesting. He lifts the binoculars hanging round his neck and looks through them. We see what he sees via one of those old-timey binocular-outline-cutout shots: it is a bird's nest on a rocky outcrop, and in the nest is a bald eagle. It looks to one side and spreads its wings in a demonstration of patriotism.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>
Gotcha, you feathered bastard.</div>

<p><i>He puts the binoculars in his bag and takes out a water bottle. There's not much water left. He holds the bottle in one hand and checks his wristwatch on the other, judging one against the other.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Yeah, I got time. I don't have to be back 'til late. This should only take me, what, two or three hours? And I got all the hours in the world!</div>

<p><i>He packs up and sets off towards the nest.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Good thing I checked though. Lucky I have my trusty wristwatch with me, so I can hold useful objects in one hand and check the time with the other. Man, I love having two hands!</div>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>EXT: CLIFF BASE - DAY</p>
<p><i>HUGH arrives at the base of the outcrop. He looks up, squinting in the Sun, and realises it's a lot higher than he realised. He checks his watch again.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Yeah, I got time. Would be a shame to spend all these hours coming here for nothing. And if there's one thing I can spare right now, it's hours!</div>

<p><i>He starts climbing.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Yep, I got all the hours a man could ask for. Ever since I got laid off from the clock store for getting all handsy with the female employees, I got nothing but hours. Told me I should keep my hands to myself in future, so I do. Hours and hours, just me and my hands.</div>

<p><i>He kisses his right hand.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Yeah, you seen your fair share of trouble. </div>

<p><i>He sees his left hand, and kisses that one too.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>You too, buddy. Trouble on both sides.</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Man, when left and right get along and work together, we can achieve great things...</div>

<p><i>He spies the eagle's nest on the cliff edge</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>... like taking back what's ours.</div>

<p><i>He tiptoes up to the nest with his hands outstretched, ready to strangle the eagle.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>I'm gonna enjoy killing you, you beaky fuck. I swear I'm gonna choke you with my bare hands, or my name isn't Hugh Bryss...</div>

<p><i>When he's finally close enough, he pounces - but the nest is empty!</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>What the ...</div>

<p><i>The eagle, silhouetted against the Sun, appears behind him. He turns around slowly ...</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Aaaargh!</div>

<p><i>The eagle flaps and squawks at HUGH, who stumbles backwards, trips, and falls off the cliff.</i></p>

<p><i>Close up on HUGH, unconscious. A coyote sniffs at the bloody wound on his head and does a little wee on it. This wakes him up.</i></p>
<div style='margin-left:40%;'>HUGH</div>

<div style='margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;'>Aaa that stings! Geez, this is starting to get out of...</div>

<p>EXT: CLIFF BASE - NIGHT</p>
<p><i>HUGH is playing five-finger-fillet by holding a penknife in his mouth. He gets bored and gives up, and ends up playing with the knife, folding it in and out. It glints in the sunlight. He looks at the blade, then looks at his trapped hand, then the knife, and then the hand, and so on, an unreasonable number of times.</i></p>

<p>108 HOURS: <i>HUGH is masturbating, but is having little success because he keeps stopping to choke himself, then has to stop choking himself to masturbate, then figures out he can't do both and gives up.</i></p>

<p>EXT: CLIFF BASE: MORNING</p>

<p><i>A bag of groceries and a freshly bandaged wrist stump show that HUGH has just arrived from the hospital. He puts the ham into a sandwich and takes it to bed.</i></p>
