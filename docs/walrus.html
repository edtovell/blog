</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>At work I've been upgrading a lot of my python projects to 3.8 for a good few months now, and I've taken the opportunity to wantonly overuse the new-as-of-3.8 walrus operator. Now that it's been long enough for me to have cause to go and <em>again</em> revisit those scripts, I can confidently say this: the walrus feels <em>so good</em> to write, and it feels <em>so bad</em> to read.</p>
<p>Just look at this bastard</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">:=</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The whole entire point of the thing - as I understand it, at least - is to reduce repetition in your list comprehensions. I didn't really mean to do yet another tutorial here, I was just trying to get my thoughts in order and it kinda turned into it, but I guess it also counts as background for making my point.</p>
<p>List comprehensions are themselves a nice way of building lists without having to think very hard about loops. Let's say you've got a bunch of these <code>Animal</code> objects:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">animals</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Cat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Walrus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Parakeet</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Esquilax</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's say - just like in every OOP tutorial - you want to get the noise each animal makes, in a list. Without list comprehension syntax you might write this loop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">noises</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>    <span class="n">noises</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">noise</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you the correct answer, <code>["woof", "meow", "arf", "caw", "reeee"]</code>, but wouldn't it be nicer to just do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">noises</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">noise</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Yep yep yep yep yep, good good good. List comprehension syntax also lets you do this cool filtering trick where you can add a condition, and it reads almost just like a sentence of English, which is super nifty:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_a_mammal</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NaN</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_a_mammal</span><span class="p">()]</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Cat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Walrus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Esquilax</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'm sure there's a good reason why <code>NaN</code> evaluates <code>True</code> but I don't know what it is, I don't like it, and I don't trust it.</p>
<p>ANYWAY AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE the entire justification for this walrus thingy - again, as far as I can tell, at least - is to ease the situation where you're cramming way too much logic into one line already and ending up repeating yourself. Wouldn't this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">DogCatcher</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">daily_capture_quota</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">DogCatcher</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">daily_capture_quota</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)]</span>
<span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Walrus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Esquilax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NaN</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>be so much more readable as this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">quota</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">animals</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">quota</span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="n">DogCatcher</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">daily_capture_quota</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">))]</span>
<span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Walrus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Esquilax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NaN</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>More readable, right? Right? Eh, sorta, at least? And I think it only executes the repeated part once instead of twice too, which is nice I guess...? I think?</p>
<p>Maybe this is just me but I love list comprehensions beyond what is reasonable, so I've been abusing the walrus to fuck. And the resulting code is just not legible. I am unwilling to show it to you for business secrets and embarassment reasons, but honestly just picture spaghetti with tangled earbuds in it.</p>
<p>I saw this Fibonacci implementation in a tweet when walrus was first released and it took me honestly like 15 to 20 minutes of staring right at it before I knew what was happening. And honestly I'm not sure if 15 to 20 minutes is like above average or what</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(I found it again on <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21862671>Hacker News</a>)</p>
<p>The other peeve I have about this thing is that every time I think about it I get <em>I Am The Walrus</em> in my head and it's a cracking tune but ... it's a lot, you know? Custard dripping from a dead dog's eye? Too much to be dealing with when I'm struggling to concentrate on these TPS reports as it is.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Like, I'm not saying we shouldn't have it, but just do it in moderation. Not too many walri, please.</p>
