Summary: 

- I get nothing done that I wanted.
- Pope dabs - world applauds.
- Prince Philip dies (because of how old he is). A sensible level of mourning quickly spills over into sycophantic jingoism.
- Jordan Peele makes something better than _Us_ (which was good) but still not as good as _Get Out_ (which was really good).
- An enormous alien squid from another dimension lands in Manhattan, killing millions. International diplomatic tensions
are forgotten as humanity unites against a perceived common enemy.
- Boris Johnson legalises murder or something.
- Joe Biden wins the democratic nomination but in typical gaffe-prone style accidentally instructs his supporters to vote for Trump.
- John Frusciante quits and rejoins the Red Hot Chili Peppers two or three more times.
